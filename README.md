# People app
## Project Overview
It can be difficult to keep track of different information about people; this app attempts to give you a way to keep all the info in one place.

## Summary

**Final App Description:**

The final app is a person information tracker, with the ability to add people into groups, add a profile picture, add custom notes, put in a role and organization for people, turn on and off darkmode, and export the data to json.

**What I liked about Cursor:**

- It sped up development by handling implementatoin, letting me focus on the design and planning
- It allowed me to focus on the high level implementation, without worrying about language specific concepts.
- It simplifed debugging of issues, allowing me to spend my time adding new stuff.

**Challenges / Issues:**

- Cursor completely removed my image upload feature, and I had to prompt it to add it back last minute
- I had to do multiple iterations for some features to get them to work, or fix newly introduced problems.
- For some prompts, I needed to regenerate a few times, while refining the prompt, to get something I was happy with.


Overall, this project helped me build a full-stack app with limited web development experience. Cursor ended up being a powerful tool, simplifying some of the developmenet process. While it worked well with some limitations, in the future, I feel like I am more likely to use other tools instead, such as Aider or Google's AI Studio.
