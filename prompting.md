### Initial prompt: {#initial-prompt:}

Create a web app that lets the user keep track of important persons they come across in their research. The home page should list the persons already entered. The home page should also have a \+ button that when clicked opens a second window, which allows a new person to be added.

Response:  
Generated an app that allows you to add people

Initial version:  
Has 2 pages, one for groups, where you can make a group of multiple people, and one for people, where you can add pages for multiple people. There are notes sections for each person, where you can store text, and you can add profile pictures. You have a login page, so you can log in for your data. All people data is persistent in a firebase db.

### Feature prompts {#feature-prompts}

#### 1.(.env) {#1.(.env)}

Prompt:  
please move all api keys and sensitive data to a .env file.

Result:  
Separated firebase config into .env with the Cloudinary stuff. Added a .env.example, for example of what it should be, updated files to use the .env file, and worked to make the .env be in the .gitignore.

#### 2.(timezone for people) {#2.(timezone-for-people)}

Prompt:  
each person should have a dropdown menu in the setup, which will allow you to select their timezone. this timezone will be saved, and on the people list, each person will have a section showing the current time in that persons timezone. the edit and add person pages should both have the timezone dropdown, while the people list should have the current time display.

Result:  
It works, though all existing profile pictures seem to have gone missing. New profile pictures work fine. It is missing some time zones, from using a small hard coded list of timezones.  
I sent another prompt of:  
 well, that works, though some timezones are not options, and existing profile pictures are no longer displayed. new profile pictrures look to work fine

That didn’t fix the problem, so I went back and figured out where the problem could be, using the prompt:  
I think the problem is that the data originally used profilePictureUrl, and now uses imageUrl

That fixed the images not showing up in the edit page, but profile pictures still didn’t show up, and closing the edit page didn’t work in some cases, so I did:

the pictures still don't show up for existing ones, but if i go in and edit, they appear. it looks like if there is missing data when editing, you cannot close the edit page, with either the x, cancel, or the update.

This fixed the profile pictures, but editing still couldn’t be closed, so I did:  
ok, it looks like the x and cancel buttons just don't work peroid on the edit person pages

That didn’t seem to do anything, so I tried:  
the cancel and the x button still do not close the form, though hitting update, even when no change made, seems to close the form.

That fixed the closing of the edit form.

I discovered that the add person button caused an error, so I used the prompt:  
when I hit the add person button, the screen goes blank, and i see the following error in console  
TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'initialData.profilePictureUrl')An error occurred in the \<PersonForm\> component.  
please fix this error for me

This seems to have fixed the error.

#### 3.(export button) {#3.(export-button)}

Prompt:  
ok, now can you add a button that exports the data from the people list and group list to a csv? this button should be on a new page, perhaps called settings or data

Result:  
It added the buttons on a new settings page, but the buttons each gave an error. I would also prefer to have a single export button, but that will happen after fixing the errors.

I then used a prompt of:  
the buttons show up on the settings page, but i get TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'person.groupIds.join') when pressing the export people list and get TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'group.memberIds.length') when pressing export group list.

This fixed the export, but the output files seemed to be missing info like the profile pictures  in the people, and the actual members in the group list

To try to fix this, I used a prompt of :  
the export looks to work fine, however there doesn't seem to be all the information needed within the exports, for example, there is no profile picture in the people export, and the groups list seems to be missing what people are actually in the group. there should be all the information that would be needed to recreate the db from scratch. 

This added the profile pictures, and some  user id fields, but the user ids were the same for all elements in both the people list and the profile list. It also added a new export all button 

I tried a prompt of:  
well, the profile pictures show up, and the group memebers look fine, however every element in both the group list and the people list has a user id, and this user id is the same for every element.

This seemed to fix the problem, but there is still a field in the people list of group ids, which seems to be only appearing in one row, and has the same value repeated 4 times, separated by semicolons.

I attempted to fix this with a prompt of:  
well the user id is now gone, but there is still the groupid column in the people list, which seems to be empty except for a single row, which contains the same string 4 times, seperated by semicolons. this doesn't seem like it is neccecary, as the groups each person is in is supposed to be stored in the groups list.

This fixed the data, though there is still separate export all and export for the individual lists, which seems confusing. To fix this, I tried a prompt of:

this seems fine, but the settings page has an export all, export people and export groups button, which seems like it is confusing, as you have 3 differnet export buttons, which export part of the data or all of it.

Things started exporting as a single file, and there was a single button, but the group members seemed to be missing. I attempted to fix this with a prompt of 

the groups data in this export seems to be missing the group members, and it seems confusing to have people and groups in the same rows section, I think exporting as json instead of csv might work better, having a separate field for the groups and people, allowing you to export it to a single file while keeping them separate

This fixed the export data, but the button is not centered, and the filename is just people-app-backup-date.json, and having a timestamp in it would be nice. I first fixed the timestamp on the file, as the centered button can be dealt with later if it is a problem

I used a prompt of:  
the export seems fine, but I would prefer there to be a time in the filename in addition to the date that is already in there. the date and time should be in the format of exactly "yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss". note that the colons are intentional, and should be included in the filename.

This added a timestamp, but it put \_ instead of colon.

I attempted to fix it with the prompt:  
the file is being saved as people\_app\_backup\_yyyy-mm-dd-hh\_mm\_ss.json, not people\_app\_backup\_yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss.json as requested. Please fix this.

This made it explicitly form the filename with the colons, but the file was still downloaded with \_ instead. 

I decided to try a prompt of:  
 Even though you are now explicitly forming the file with the colons, the file still has the \_ instead when  you download it. Is this a limitation of the system, or is there some other bug

This gave a response saying browsers automatically remove colons and replace them, since filenames with : are not supported on most OS.

I then had it simplify the code using a prompt of:

 can you please make it go back to using the iso datetime, instead of explicitly creating the filename?

This slightly changed the filename, to have a T and a Z, but it now fits with standard time formats.(iso)

#### 4.(dark mode settings) {#4.(dark-mode-settings)}

Prompt:  
Now add a dark mode dropdown on the settings page. This should allow you to select between dark mode, light mode, and matching system dark mode settings. When dark mode is on, the ui should update accordingly. make sure the ui updates whenever you change the dark mode setting.

Result:  
I got a working darkmode, but the people cards and group cards are still light, rather than dark. 

I tried fixing this with the prompt of:  
that mostly worked, but the cards for the people and groups are both still white on dark mode. while some fonts are occasionally white as well, this is less important, as it keeps the text readable.

That fixed darkmode, but some text was grey while others is white, which should probably be changed for consistency

I tried fixing it with the prompt:  
The text within the  .settings-container  h2 and .section-header h2 styling  all seem to be kind of bluish grey in dark mode, and a little hard to read. their color should be black in light mode, and then consistent with the rest of the interface in dark mode. note that the problem is specifically in the h2, not in h3. everything else seems fine about them, just the color is off. note that .section-header is defined in app.css

This seemed to fix the problem

#### 5.(group name tags on people list) {#5.(group-name-tags-on-people-list)}

Prompt:  
now make it so that the groups a person is in shows up as tags with the group name on the people cards. this should be added on only to people cards for people who are in at least one group, since not everyone is in a group. if a person is in multiple groups, they should have multiple group name tags.

This seemed to work , though it took 2 tries, and I accidentally  went back to an earlier version, and had to restore from github.

### UI Prompts: {#ui-prompts:}

#### 1.(fixing contrast) {#1.(fixing-contrast)}

Prompt:  
please make sure all text has enough contrast to be easily readable in both dark and light mode. this includes text in the add group and add person forms, as well as text  visible on pages.

This made the contrast, especially on the adding forms, better, so things were actually readable

#### 2.(Aligning buttons in add person form) {#2.(aligning-buttons-in-add-person-form)}

Prompt:  
Please make sure the add person and cancel buttons in the add person form are aligned.

This aligned the buttons by putting them next to each other

#### 3.(adding x button to person form) {#3.(adding-x-button-to-person-form)}

Prompt:   
Add an x button to the top right corner of the add person form, that acts the same as the cancel button.

This added the x button as requested

#### 4.(logout button positioning) {#4.(logout-button-positioning)}

Prompt:  
move the logout  button to be a link in the navbar instead

This positioned the logout button where I wanted it.

#### 5.(resizing login page, and main pages to go with it.) {#5.(resizing-login-page,-and-main-pages-to-go-with-it.)}

Prompt:  
make the login page be wider, so it is closer in width to the pages you see when logged in currently, it is so small that the email and password inputs don't even fit in it.

That didn’t really do much, so I added a prompt of :  
that didn't seem to do much, and the login page is barely wide enough to contain the elements on it, and the main app is much wider

This made everything much wider, and had every page take up the full width. 

This was a little too wide, so I tried this prompt:  
Instead of having every  page take up 100% of the width of the window, can you make it take up 90%, and center the content in the window?

This did what I wanted, and made it a more reasonable size.

### All Prompts: {#all-prompts:}

Refinements:  
Prompt:  
please move all api keys and sensitive data to a .env file.

Result:  
Separated firebase config into .env with the Cloudinary stuff. Added a .env.example, for example of what it should be, updated files to use the .env file, and worked to make the .env be in the .gitignore.

Prompt:  
each person should have a dropdown menu in the setup, which will allow you to select their timezone. this timezone will be saved, and on the people list, each person will have a section showing the current time in that persons timezone. the edit and add person pages should both have the timezone dropdown, while the people list should have the current time display.

That didn’t seem to do anything, so I tried:  
the cancel and the x button still do not close the form, though hitting update, even when no change made, seems to close the form.

That fixed the closing of the edit form.

I discovered that the add person button caused an error, so I used the prompt:

#### Aider prompt after cursor stopped working

(Cursor required pro subscription to continue, so used aider for this)  
Prompt:  
 /architect It seems like you removed uploading profile pictures  to Cloudinary that was in here at some point, and replaced it with just links to the images. please put the image upload back. Remember, the link will be needed for the  json export, but for the add person form and edit person form, you should just upload images, with the link stuff behind the scenes. In the edit form, if there is a profile picture already, you should show it, loading from the stored link, but also allow for uploading a different one if the user clicks on the profile picture image. The image should be within a circle. if no profile picture is uploaded, a placeholder of the first letter of their name should be used

This fixed the profile picture stuff, but made it so clicking anywhere on the add person page brought up the upload menu. I attempted to fix this using the prompt:

 /architect that fixed the profile picture upload, but now clicking anywhere on the add person and edit person forms brings up the file upload menu, rather than just when clicking on the profile picture image. This is a problem, because it prevents clicking on other parts of the form, and should be fixed.  
                              
This fixed it, but there was no message about click to upload on the empty circle in the add person form. I used the prompt:  
 /architect if the circle on the add person form that holds the profile picture is blank, the circle should have the text “click to upload” within it. This ensures that it is clear to the user how to upload an image when creating a new user.

This worked, now I want the profile pictures in the edit form  to have a click to upload as well. I still want the image to appear in the people list, but in the edit form, it should have the click to upload text, like in the add person form. I used the prompt:  
 /architect now I want the profile pictures in the edit form  to have a click to upload  text as well. I still want the image to appear in the people list, but in the edit form, it should have the  click to upload text, like in the add person form.

This worked when there was no existing profile picture, but for existing profile pictures, the existing image was shown in the edit form, rather than the click to upload text. I tried the prompt:  
 /architect  while this worked for the placeholder images with just the single letter, if there was an existing profile picture, that was shown in the edit form, rather than the click to upload text that was expected. Remember, I don’t want to change how the profile pictures are displayed in the people list, just how they show up in the edit profile form.

This worked as intended, though I would prefer it if for existing images, it had the click to upload text overlaid on the existing image, instead of replacing it in the edit form. To do this, i tried a prompt of:  
 /architect  ok, that worked, but I would prefer it if, when there was an existing image, that image would be shown in the edit person form, but with the click to upload text overlaid on it. It should have enough contrast to be readable,  perhaps by slightly dimming the existing image, and putting a slightly transparent background on the click to upload text. If there is just a single letter placeholder, indicating no profile was uploaded, then there should be no change from the current behavior. This means you should ensure that the profile picture placeholders remain as circle images, and are placed the same as the profile pictures that are uploaded. You should probably have a separate condition for if there is a image url  for a person in the person list, and if there isn’t one, to handle this properly. In other words, in the edit form, you should always have a click to upload text, but if there is an existing image url, you should display that image, with the click to upload text as an overlay, with a background that is semitransparent, to help ensure readability of the text. The opacity of the overlay should be around 25%, while the opacity of the existing images that the overlay is added to should be 100%. The single letter placeholder profile images should have the letter centered in the circle, and relatively large. Remember that the single letter placeholder images should not be visible in the edit person form, but the normal, uploaded images with an image url should be shown, behind the overlay.

This fixed it somewhat, but didn’t account for `profilePictureUrl and imageUrl both having the possibility of holding the profile picture. To fix this, I used the prompt:`  
 /architect while that partially works, the db has the profile pictures stored either in `profilePictureUrl or imageUrl, depending on when it was added. You should adjust the code to account for this.`

That fixed it, though the placeholder images have the overlay put on an image with the click to upload text.  
I tried the prompt   
 /architect in the edit form, if we had a placeholder image for the profile picture, instead of a url, we show an image that has the text click to upload, and put an overlay with the same text over it. Instead, for consistency, we should show a blank image, and put the overlay over it.

Running locally with npm run dev worked fine, but npm run build had build errors, preventing building on Vercel. I fixed this using aider, with /run npm run build, which added the command output to chat context, then used the default prompt of:  
What's wrong? Fix   
This ended up fixing 7 of the 8 build errors the first time, so I did it again, and it fixed the remaining build errors.
